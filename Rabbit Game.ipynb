You goal is to pick which hole the rabbit is hiding in in the least amount of time or fewest number of turns.\n\n##### Rules\n1. You can only look in one hole at a time.\n2. Every time you look in a hole that the rabbit isn't in the rabbit jumps to a hole adjacent to it's previous position.\n3. The rabbit can jump to the hole that you just guessed.\n4. The holes are arranged in a line, not a circle. The rabbit cannot jump from the start position to the end position.","metadata":{},"id":"4378e0e4-1178-404e-a6f1-9f3adf85ba65"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import random\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib as mpl","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[],"id":"5a71922e-55d2-43e0-b2d8-49a952aeff8b"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Setting up the game","metadata":{},"id":"98f26796-7c2f-4573-9950-067467e2035f"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"number_of_holes = 100\nturns = 0\nmax_turns = 1000 # this is in case your algo really sucks... we don't want to burn down someone's datacenter\ninitial_rabbit_position = random.randint(0, number_of_holes)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[],"id":"4201afa3-db2c-40e1-aad9-eee3c08e5ebc"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def game (look_method, number_of_holes, max_turns):\n    result","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"traceback":["\u001b[0;36m  File \u001b[0;32m\"<ipython-input-4-d28bd04e6e8a>\"\u001b[0;36m, line \u001b[0;32m1\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;31m    def game (look_method, number_of_holes, max_turns):\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m                                                       ^\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;31mSyntaxError\u001b[0m\u001b[0;31m:\u001b[0m unexpected EOF while parsing\n"],"ename":"SyntaxError","evalue":"unexpected EOF while parsing (<ipython-input-4-d28bd04e6e8a>, line 1)","output_type":"error"}],"id":"3bbfebaa-aabc-4326-b56e-e1f407720246"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"d4c28c93-3bee-4462-88a8-78f5e20bc940"}]}
